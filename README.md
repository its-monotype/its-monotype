# Hi there 👋 I'm Pavlo

I'm a Frontend Engineer with a strong UI/UX background. I enjoy designing and building clean, user-friendly apps.

💻 I work primarily with TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and related technologies

📚 Currently exploring Rust and Tauri to build modern cross-platform apps

🌱 Also getting curious about Svelte
