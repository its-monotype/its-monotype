# Hi there ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)

I'm a **Frontend Developer** passionate about crafting beautiful and user-friendly interfaces. I enjoy designing and coding to bring ideas to life.

Core stack: JS & TS, **React**, Next.js, Tailwind CSS

For personal projects, I use NestJS and Python when needed, but my true passion is frontend development - l'd rather leave backend work to the experts in a team setting.

I'm currently exploring Rust and Tauri to build blazing-fast cross-platform apps.
